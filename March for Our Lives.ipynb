    "# STUDY OF U.S. MASS SCHOOL SHOOTINGS\n",
    "\n",
    "## By: Gavin Schilling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are records of instances of school shootings in the United States dating back to the Enoch Brown school massacre in Greencastle, PA on July 26, 1764, the first mass school shooting according to the modern convention of counting a mass school shooting as being a three person or more casualty on the actual school grounds did not occur until March 26, 1893 in Plain Dealing, LA during an evening dance at the school.  According to Wikipedia between then and 1966 only three other mass school shootings occurred.  They were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The December 13, 1898 Charleston, WV school exhibition incident killing 6 and wounding at least 1 other\n",
    "* The May 6, 1940 Pasadena, CA - South Pasadena Junior High School - murders leaving 5 dead and 2 others wounded\n",
    "* The February 2, 1960 Hartford City, IN - William Reed School - shooting killing 3\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that only four modern day standard mass school shootings occurred before 1966 even though around 130 school-related shootings are on record with Wikipedia from this early time period in America history.  Thankfully, the rest of these horrific events do not meet the modern definition of being a mass school shooting by today's standards as outlined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1968 & 1970, a total of 9 student protesters were killed and another 48 were injured at the hands of United States government officers.  Those two years the following three major mass incidents occurred included the disgraceful South Carolina State University racist protesters in Orangeburg, SC on February 8, 1968, the Kent State University Vietnam War protesters being gunned down by armed National Guard solders on May 4, 1970 in Kent, OH, and when the police shot the protestors at the Jackson State University in Jackson, MS over the United States' military presence in Cambodia on May 15, 1970 (occurring only eleven days following the Kent State massacre).\n",
    "\n",
    "While, the Columbine High School massacre did not happen until 1999, these attacks by the United States government and the August 1, 1966 University of Texas - Austin massacre in Austin, Texas killing 17 and wounding 31 paired with the November 12, 1966 (roughly 3.5 months after the University of Texas massacre) in Mesa, AZ where 5 died and another 2 were injured, set off a new type of shock value for the vast increase number killed in any particular incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in the first month and a half of 2018, the United States not only has had the deadliest mass school shooting in United States history, but has had the school shooting rate increase to 1 occurring in every 60 hours.  Many National Rifle Association (NRA) backed politicians continue to look the other way or actively try to stall any and all gun-control reform or legislation.\n",
